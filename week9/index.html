            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any
                    variables that are created in the global scope are actually
                    properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a browser environment the global object is the window object,
                    which represents the browser window that contains a web page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods
                    that contain information about the browser and computer screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window
                    object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In general, you should refer to global variables without using the
                    window object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide
                    information about the user’s browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Navigator object contains information about the browser being
                    used. Its userAgent property will return information about the
                    browser and operating system being used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.location property is an object that contains information
                    about the URL of the current page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The search property returns a string that starts with a '?' followed by the
                    query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no
                    query string parameters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain
                    where the current page originated from.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page.
                    If it’s given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload
                    the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL
                    provided as a parameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.history property can be used to access information about
                    any previously visited pages in the current browser session.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been
                    visited before arriving at the current page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page,
                    where 0 is the current page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new window can be opened using the window.open() method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The close() method can be used to close a window
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.screen object contains information about the screen the
                    browser is displayed on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and
                    width of the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value
                    pairs separated by semicolons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding the string '; secure' to the end of a cookie will ensure it’s
                    only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its
                    firstparameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 14: JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using
                    custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The restriction of only using a string value can be overcome by
                    encoding any JavaScript object or value as a JSON string, then
                    performing type-conversion later, as required.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s
                    computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer
                    restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of
                    the device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navigator
                    object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in
                    meters per second.
                </li>
                <li>
                    position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s
                    altitude.
                </li>
                <li>
                    position.heading property returns the direction the device is
                    moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from
                    North.
                </li>
                <li>
                    position.timestamp property returns the time that the position
                    information was recorded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding
                    support for concurrency in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a
                    server – also known as push messaging.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s
                    notifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before you can send notifications, you need to get permission granted
                    by the user. This can be achieved using the requestPermission() method
                    of a Notification global object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using
                    JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The play() method will start the clip playing from its current position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pause() method will pause the clip at its current position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to
                    another part of the clip.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by
                    changing its value. A value of 1 is playback at normal speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The loop property is a boolean value that can be set to true to make the
                    clip repeat in a loop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after
                    a pause.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.
