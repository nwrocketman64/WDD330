            <h3>Chapter 2 - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Using comments in your code is very important and good use of comments is
                    a mark of a professional programmer verse a novice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    // and /* */ are used for comments in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alway use semicolons when needed even if it doesn't cause error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The const keyword is used when the variable will not change and the let
                    keyword is used when the variable will change in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Variables with a global scope should be used little if not at all to
                    keep the code clean and to prevent bugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript variable names should follow the camelCase style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using wrappers, JavaScript provide function for primatives values 
                    even though they are not objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Template Literals use the backtick instead of quotes to define
                    strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    0x represents hexadecimals and 0o represents octal literals and 0b
                    represents binary numbers and e1 is exponental notation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The range of numbers JavaScript can handle is -1.7976931348623157e+308
                    to 1.7976931348623157e+308 and the smallest number JavaScript can handle
                    is 5e-324.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NaN === NaN returns false and so use .isNaN() function instead.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 3 - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array
                    and presenting them as individual values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The pop, push, shift, and unshift methods are useful in add and removing
                    values to and from the array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the join function for converting the array to a string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reverse and sort methods are useful in ordering an array. They also
                    change the array permantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sets are useful if you have a collection of data and you don't want to
                    check to see if there is any duplicates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sets do not use an index.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A set can be converted into an array using the spread operator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A memory leak occurs when a program retains references to values that
                    can no longer be accessed in its memory. This can slow down the program
                    and even break the system if it turns out really bad.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The weak set can be used to prevent memory leaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Maps are like other objects but are used primarly for storage and retrival
                    and they are very effencent at that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Maps can be converted into an array using the spread operator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A weak map can be used to prevent memory leaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript has if else statements that are similar to the way they
                    are used in C++.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript has loops that are similar to the way they are used in
                    C++.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sets and Maps have methods that let you loop through them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 4 - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Function can be decleared using function declearation, function
                    expression, or with the function constructor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We should not repeat code in our programs but use functions to
                    store blocks of code and call the function as much as we need to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All functions return a value and if they don't return anything,
                    then they actually return undefined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hoisting is moving all the variables from a function to the scope
                    above it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A callback is when a function is passed in as a parameter to another
                    function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Arrow functions can be used to declear a function.
                </li>
            </ul>
