            <ul>
                <li>
                    A system error is when there's a problem with the
                    system or external devices which the program is working
                    with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmer error is when the program contains
                    incorrect syntac or faulty logic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user error is when the user enters data incorrectly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must
                    ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed
                    promptly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An exception is an error that produces a return value
                    that can then be used by the program to deal with the
                    error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A stack trace is a sequence of functions or methods
                    calls that lead to the point where the error
                    occurred.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code
                    that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in
                    various environments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmers should ensure that the code they write fails
                    loudly in development so any errors can be identified
                    and fixed quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and
                    prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'use strict'; will turn on strict mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modules run in strict mode by default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linting tools can be used to test the quality of
                    JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use an if statement to check if the browser supports
                    a certain feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can use alerts to make a breakpoint in the code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use console logs for debugging.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The debugger; keyword will act as a proper breakpoint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The throw keyword acts as an assert.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the try and catch blocks for exception handling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The finally block is added after the catch block and
                    it will run even if no exception has happened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of
                    writing tests before any actual code.
