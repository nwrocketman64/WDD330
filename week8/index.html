            <h3>Chapter 8 - HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can edit an element's appearance using transform
                    functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Translation functions allow you to move elements left,
                    right, up, or down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When you employ a translation function, you’re moving
                    elements without impacting the flow of the document.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you only want to move an element vertically or
                    horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey
                    functions respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transforms don’t work on inline elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the
                    defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only
                    one value is provided, it will be used for both the x
                    and y values, growing or shrinking your element while
                    maintaining the original aspect ratio.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink
                    inwards towards its center.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rotate() function rotates an element around the
                    point of origin by a specified angle value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with
                    positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving
                    counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can
                    be provided in grads, radians, or turns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x
                    and y axes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As with translate and scale, there are axis-specific
                    versions of the skew transform: skewX() and skewY().
                </li>
                <li>
                    Native CSS transitions generally require less
                    client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear
                    smoother.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the CSS transition, property the color transition
                    can be gradual.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can animate any of the transforms we’ve just seen,
                    so that our pages feel more dynamic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transition-property property defines the CSS
                    properties of the element that should be transitioned,
                    with all for all properties being the default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transition-duration property sets how long the
                    transition will take: the duration of time it takes
                    to go from the default state to the transitioned
                    state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a
                    transition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transition-timing-function lets you control the
                    pace of the transition in even more granular detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to
                    introduce a delay before the transition begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transition property is shorthand for the four
                    transition properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transition properties allow for multiple
                    transitions in one call.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to
                    control each step of an animation via keyframes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-duration property defines the length
                    of time an animation takes to complete one iteration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-timing-function determines how the
                    animation will progress over its duration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-iteration-count property lets you
                    define how many times the animation will play through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-delay property is used to define how
                    many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the
                    browser begins the animation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-fill-mode property defines what happens
                    before the first animation iteration begins and after
                    the last animation iteration concludes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation-play-state property defines whether
                    the animation is running or paused.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation property takes as its value a
                    space-separated list of values for the longhand
                    animation-name, animation-duration,
                    animation-timing-function, animation-delay,
                    animation-iteration-count, animation-direction,
                    animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state
                    properties.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 12 - HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All drawing on the canvas happens via the
                    Canvas JavaScript API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The context is the place where your drawing is
                    rendered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    createPattern takes two parameters: the image
                    to create the pattern with, and how that image
                    should be repeated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An arc is a segment of a circle, but as there’s no
                    method for creating a circle, we can draw a 360°
                    arc. We create it using the arc method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can use the API’s toDataURL method to save our
                    drawing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once we’ve drawn an image on the canvas, we can
                    use the getImageData method from the Canvas API to
                    manipulate the pixels of that image.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data contains information about the pixels in the
                    ImageData object in the form of an array. Each
                    pixel on the canvas will have four values in the
                    data array, which correspond to that pixel’s R, G,
                    B, and A values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A major downside of canvas in its current form is
                    its lack of accessibility. The canvas doesn’t
                    create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and
                    is thus essentially invisible to tools such as
                    screen readers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unlike canvas, images created with SVG are available
                    via the DOM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the Drag and Drop API. This API allows us to specify
                    that certain elements are draggable, and then
                    specify what should happen when these draggable
                    elements are dragged over or dropped onto other
                    elements on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that draggable is not a Boolean attribute,
                    so you have to explicitly set it to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    DataTransfer objects are one type of object
                    outlined in the Drag and Drop API. These objects
                    allow us to set and get data about the elements
                    that are being dragged.
