                    It is neat to know that JavaScript has a built in storge system where
                    the user can store data on their computer via the web browers but I feel
                    there is a lot of limits to what can be done with the localStorage when
                    compared to what a database server can do. There is some uses though where
                    it can be useful so it is good to know how to access it.
                    <h3>Questions:</h3>

                            Is localStorage a popular way to persist data in real world
                            applications? Or is it just a work around when we don't want to deal
                            with sessions, or even an actual database?
                            <p>
                                I would say that localStorage is just a work around when we don't
                                want to deal with sessions or databases to store the users data.
                                I don't know of many online applications that use it as it main
                                way of storage and so it primary use would just be to store
                                something quick for the user and not bog down the server with
                                needless information. Those are my thoughts on the subject.
