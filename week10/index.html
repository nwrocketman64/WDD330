            <h3>MDN: Validating forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server
                    will check to see that the data is in the correct format
                    and within the constraints set by the application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Validation done in the browser is called client-side
                    validation, while validation done on the server is
                    called server-side validation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Never trust data passed to your server from the client.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation
                    features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    required - Specifies whether a form field needs to be
                    filled in before the form can be submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    minlength and maxlength - Specifies the minimum and maximum
                    length of textual data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    min and max - Specifies the minimum and maximum values of
                    numerical input types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    type - Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an
                    email address, or some other specific preset type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    pattern - Specifies a regular expression that defines a
                    pattern the entered data needs to follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used
                    to match character combinations in text strings, so
                    regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety
                    of other uses in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The textarea element doesn't support the pattern attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over
                    the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with
                    legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form
                    validation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    validationMessage - Returns a localized message describing
                    the validation constraints that the control doesn't
                    satisfy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    validity - Returns a ValidityState object that contains
                    several properties describing the validity state of the
                    element.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>MDN: Using Fetch</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing
                    and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests
                    and responses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers
                    object via the Headers() constructor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are
                    resolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Response.status — An integer containing the response status
                    code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Response.statusText — A string, which corresponds to the HTTP
                    status code message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for
                    checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive.
                    This returns a Boolean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Both requests and responses may contain body data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fetch API support can be detected by checking for the existence
                    of Headers, Request, Response or fetch() on the Window or Worker
                    scope.
                </li>
