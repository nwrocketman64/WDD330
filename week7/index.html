            <ul>
                <li>
                    functions are first-class objects means they can have
                    properties and methods themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The call() method can be used to set the value of this
                    inside a function to an object that is provided as the
                    first argument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can add a property to a function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We cache the results of a function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An Immediately Invoked Function Expression is an
                    anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is
                    invoked as soon as it’s defined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside
                    its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any
                    other part of the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A function can define or redefine itself in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A recursive function is one that invokes itself until
                    a certain condition is met.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven
                    asynchronous programming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Callback hell is the term used to refer to using tons
                    of callbacks in a tangled mess of code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A promise represents the future result of an
                    asynchronous operation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A promise is created using a constructor function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can
                    be used to deal with the outcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If each function that performs an asynchronous operation
                    returns a promise, we can chain the then() methods
                    together to form a sequential piece of code that’s
                    easy to read. Each promise will only begin once the
                    previous promise has been settled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Callbacks can be used to build more generalized
                    functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Functions can return a function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A closure is a reference to a variable that was created
                    inside the scope of another function, but is then kept
                    alive and used in another part of the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generators are special functions that used to produce
                    iterators that maintain the state of a value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Functional programming is a programming paradigm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Higher-order functions are functions that accept another
                    function as an argument, or return another function as a
                    result, or both.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currying is a process that involves the partial
                    application of functions.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate
                    asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates
                    web pages without reloading. This enables data to be
                    sent and received in the background, as well as portions
                    of a page to be updated in response to user events,
                    while the rest of the program continues to run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource
                    (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the
                    request and sends back a response to the client
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only
                    has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the
                    resource you wish to fetch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another
                    URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The text() method takes a stream of text from the
                    response, reads it to completion and then returns a
                    promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be
                    treated as a string in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data,
                    such as an image or a spreadsheet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX
                    responses. The json() method is used to deal with these
                    by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise
                    that resolves to a JavaScript object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can get more fine-grained control over the request
                    being made by providing a Request object as an argument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional
                    information about a request or response. Typical
                    information contained in headers includes the file-type
                    of the resource, cookie information, authentication
                    information and when the resource was last modified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which
                    makes it much easier to submit information in forms
                    using Ajax.
