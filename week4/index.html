            <ul>
                <li>
                    Forms are a commonly used method of interatint with a
                    web page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forms use the form tage and in it contains form
                    controls such as input fields, select menus and
                    buttons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can use document.forms or form.elements or we
                    can use form['elementname'] to access the contents of
                    the form elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The form.submit() function will submit the form
                    automatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The form.reset() function will reset all the form
                    controls back to their initial values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The form.action() function can be uesed to set the
                    action attribute of a form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The focus event occurs when an element is focused on.
                    The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus
                    away from the form element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The change event occurs when the user moves the
                    focus away from the form element after changing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A submit event listener can be added to intercept the
                    form data before it is sent to the server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Text input element objects have a value property that
                    can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The autofocus attribute give focus to the element
                    when the page loads.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The placeholder attribute will insert the value
                    provided in the input field until the user enters
                    some text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The maxlength attribute will limit the number of
                    characters that can be entered in the field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The default type of input field is text, which is
                    used for entering a short piece of text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Input type = "password" is used to enter passwords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Input type = "checkbox" is used to create check
                    boxes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A checkbox can be set to true with JavaScript by
                    setting its checked property to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Input type = "radio" is used to create radio buttons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Input type = "hidden" is used to create a hidden
                    field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hidden fields can be seen in the HTML so they
                    shouldn't be use to contain sensitive data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Input type = "file" is used to upload a file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML5 has new inputs including number, tel, and
                    color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A textarea element is used to enter long pieces of
                    text over multiple lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Submit is the default type for a button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Form validation is the process of checking whether
                    a user has entered the information into a form
                    correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Validation can happen on the client side and on the
                    server side and you should use both.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML5 has its own validation API that can be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The disable attribute can be used to disable the
                    submit button.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 12 - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Object-oriented programming is a style of
                    programming that involves separating the code into
                    objects that have properties and methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation,
                    polymorphism and inheritance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In encapsulation, the inner working are kept hidden
                    inside the object and only the essential functions
                    are exposed to the end user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In polymorphism, the same process can be used for
                    different objects or various objects can share the
                    same methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In inheritance, we can take an object that already
                    exists and inherit all its properties and methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A class is used as a blueprint to define an instance
                    of that class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The keyword this is used to represent the object that
                    is returned by the constructor functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can use the class declaration to create a new
                    class in JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Class names are capitalized by convention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All objects have a constructor property that returns
                    the constructor function that created it
                </li>
                <li>
                    The static keyword is used to create a static method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can use the prototype property of a class to add
                    a property or method to class after it has been created.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can use the getPrototypeOf() function to get the
                    list of protoype functions of an object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hasOwnProperty() function gets the functions
                    that an object has as it's own property and not
                    those that inherited.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The prototype should be used to define any
                    properties that will remain the same for every
                    instance of the class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By default, an object's methods are public in
                    JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using getter and setter methods with private property
                    can be use to maintain the integrty of the data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a property of an object isn't enumerable, then it
                    won't show up in a for-loop that is used to loop
                    through the object's properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The propertyIsEnumerable() function is used to see
                    if a property is enumerable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The concept of polymorphism means that different
                    objects can have the same method, but implement it in
                    different ways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The create method can be used to create a new object
                    that is an exact copy of the object that is provided
                    as an argument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of
                    some objects to another object without using inheritance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a method returns this, its methods can be chained
                    together to form a sequence of methods calls.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Chapter 15 - JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A module is a self-contained piece of code that
                    provides functions and methods that can then be used
                    in other files and by other modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The export keyword is used to specify any value or
                    function that will be made available from the
                    module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use import keyword to bring in a variable or
                    function from another module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Default exports refer to a single variable,
                    function or class in a module that can be imported
                    without having to be explicitly named.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Having more than one default export will result in
                    a syntax error.
                </li>
